## Important

There were a few differences and errors in the API given in the task. The first and most important is the lack of a character/planet/vehicle avatar, which is why default images are set. Some data provided in the task was not included in the returned data, so it was replaced with other data.

## How to start

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
